Model predictive control (MPC) approach is the basic feedback scheme, combined with high adaptive\nproperties, which determines its successful use in the practice of design and operation of control systems. These\nadvantages allow managing multidimensional objects with a complex structure, including nonlinearity, optimizing\nprocesses in real time within the constraints on controlled and managed variables, taking into account uncertainties\nin the task of objects and perturbations.\nObjective. The purpose of the paper is to design and analyse control system of carbon monoxide oxidation in the\nconvector cavity based on MPC with linear-quadratic cost functional with constraint.\nMethods. The design of MPC is based on mathematical model of an object (relatively simple). At the current step,\nthe prediction of object dynamic response on some final period of time (prediction horizon) is carried out; control\noptimization is performed, the purpose of which is to approximate the control variables of the prediction model to\nthe corresponding setpoint on the predict horizon. The found optimal control is applied and measurement of an\nactual state of object at the end of a step is carried out. The prediction horizon is shifted one step further, and this\nalgorithm are repeated.\nResults. The results of modeling the automatic control system show that the MPC approach provides maintenance\nof carbon dioxide content when changing oxygen consumption and overshoot caused by introduction bulk does not\nexceed 0.6 % that meets the technological requirements of the process.\nConclusions. A fuse of the MPC and the quadratic functional given the constraints on the input signals is proposed.\nThe problems of control degree of carbon oxidation in the convector cavity include non-stationarity, so the use of\nclassical control methods is difficult. The MPC approach minimizes the cost function that characterizes the quality\nof the process. The predicted behaviour of a dynamic system will usually differ from its actual motion. The obtained\nquadratic functional is optimized to find the optimal control of degree of CO oxidation to CO2.\nKeywords: model predictive control; linear-quadratic cost functional; state space model; control system.","content_00":"Introduction","content_01":"The idea of optimizing the predicted control\naction, which forms the basis of model predictive\ncontrol (MPC) methods, has arisen within the\nframework of two independent approaches. The first\none is known as Model Algorithmic Control (MAC)\npresented by Richalet et al. [1] proceedings and the\nsecond one is Dynamic Matrix Control (DMC)\npresented by Cutler and Ramaker [2] proceedings.\nThe evolution of the MPC and the overview of its\nindustrial applications are described in [3]. Although\n90 % of all controllers use PID-laws [4], MPC has\nquickly became famous, particularly in the chemical\nprocess industries due to simplicity of the algorithm\nand to the use of the impulse or step response model. ","content_02":"The general set of MPC strategy components\nconsists of a process model, a performance index,\nconstraints and an optimization method. Process\nmodels can be both linear and nonlinear or even a\nset of model combination [5–7] with input and/or\noutput constraints as an explicit part of the models.\nP. Tatjewski, M. Ławryńczuk in [8] assume that\nsuch processes exist under influence of external disturbances and their models are not precise. A comprehensive comparison of disturbance state modelling approaches is described. A performance index,\nalso known as the cost function, is designed in such\nway that makes possible to get a convex space of\nsolution variations. It requires application of optimization algorithms. In some cases [9] it is not\nso difficult to relate the cost function to economic\nperformance. The receding horizon – a quantity of\ncomputing steps of the future model states based on\nthe present and past system conditions – is an additional adjustment parameter of a final control law.","content_03":"Some researchers combine MPC with different control approaches like fuzzy-logic [10], artificial neural networks [11] or it can be used for\noptimal set points or tracking trajectories [12] for\nlocal control loops with familiar controllers. Hierarchical structures of MPC because of complexity\nof closed solutions are proposed in [13]. The tradeoff between the achieved performance and complexity of the implementation in an application\nfor process control industry is investigated in [14]. "
